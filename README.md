Dynamic Site a Python project for DPWP

Dynamic Site is a web application created using Python for my Design Patterns for Web Programming class at Full Sail University. This was my final project for this class utilizing all the information I had learned. The App was tested using google app engine which is now deprecated due to google upgrading to cloud services. All the code has been checked with pep8 online checker and is pep8 compliant.
